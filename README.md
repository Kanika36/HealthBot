Problem Statement/Opportunity*:
Our symptom checker takes just a few minutes to complete and it is completely anonymous.
Our symptom checker utilizes sophisticated natural language processing software that is applied to medical database of disease imformation consisting of thousands of different health conditions.
The combination of symptoms and health and imformation is analayzed by an enhanced machine learning modle that produces a list of possible matching conditions such as the flu or many other aliments.You can then research those conditions and locate conditions and locate doctors to help diagnose and treat them.
This symptom checker now includes the ability to select symptoms by body location.
The patients can easily identify the disease by just imputing their issues and the software generates what disease he/she may be infected from. 
The system will prove helpful in urgent cases where the patient is unable to reach hospital or in cases when there are no 
doctors available in the area.
